### Charles Homework: Traffic capture
Ex_0: Focus on below listed queries
```
protocol: http
IP: 162.55.220.72
Port: ####
```
-----------------
#### Ex_1:
+ Method: GET
+ Endpoint: /get_method
+ Request url params:
```
name: str
age: int
```
+ Response:
``` json
[
    "str",
    "str"
]
```
Tasks:
+ Do it in both Rewrite and BreakPoint (you can disable it so that it doesn’t stop on each request)
+ Change the url in Charles so that the request leaves the name that you entered in Postman, and returns the one that you substituted in Charles.
-------------------
#### Ex_2:
+ Method: POST
+ Endpoint: /user_info_3
+ Request form data:
```
name: str
age: int
salary: int
```
+ Response:
```json
{
 "name": "name",
 "age": "age",
 "salary": "salary",
 "family": {
            "children": [
                        ["Alex", 24],
                        ["Kate", 12]
                        ],
            "u_salary_1_5_year": "salary * 4"
            }
}
```
Tasks:
+ Do it in both Rewrite and BreakPoint (you can disable it so that it doesn’t stop on each request)

#### Ex_3:
+ Method: GET
+ Endpoint: /object_info_1
+ Request url params:
```
name: str
age: int
weight: int
```

```json
{
 "name": "name",
 "age": "age",
 "daily_food": "weight * 0.012",
 "daily_sleep": "weight * 2.5"
 }

Tasks:
+ Do it in both Rewrite and BreakPoint (you can disable it so that it doesn’t stop on each request)
